1) Was difficult setting the prompts because for different questions, I needed to engineer the prompts such that there will not be repetitions of questions (I got repetitions - at a point, only addition questions were coming) - had to craft the prompt in such a way that the questions were diversified.

2) Since prompting didn't give me what I needed, I had to actually refer to questions dataset and feed it into the system so that I got more refinded questions.

3) While using AI, prompt engineering is really important. First I had to give the AI agent role as python teacher, then for the answering part, the role had to be given as Python solver.

4) Problem aroused when I had to validate the answers the user was giving, the users may use different variables and stuff which are different from the ones that AI is generating.
